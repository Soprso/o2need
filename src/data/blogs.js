                heading: 'Why Start with Indoor Plants?',
                body: 'Indoor plants do more than beautify your space. Studies from NASA and leading universities show that common houseplants like the Peace Lily and Spider Plant can remove up to 87% of air toxins in 24 hours. Beyond air quality, plants reduce cortisol levels, improve focus, and create a calming environment that boosts productivity at home and work.',

                heading: 'Choosing Your First Plant',
                body: 'The golden rule for beginners: start with a forgiving plant. Top picks include the Golden Pothos (thrives in almost any light condition and forgives irregular watering), the Snake Plant (practically indestructible — survives weeks without water), the ZZ Plant (born for low-light offices and dim rooms), and the Peace Lily (gorgeous white flowers, minimal care requirements). Avoid plants like Fiddle Leaf Figs or Orchids for your first attempt — they require more attention and specific conditions.',

                heading: 'Understanding Light Requirements',
                body: 'Light is the single most important factor for plant health. Before buying a plant, assess where you will keep it. South-facing windows get the most light (ideal for succulents, herbs). East/West-facing windows have moderate light (great for Monstera, Pothos). North-facing rooms have low light (suitable for Ferns, ZZ Plants, Snake Plants). A common beginner mistake is placing sun-loving plants far from windows in artistic spots — they will slowly decline. Use a light meter app on your phone to measure your room\'s lux levels if unsure.',

                heading: 'Watering — The Most Common Mistake',
                body: 'Overwatering kills more plants than underwatering. As a rule: push your finger 1 inch into the soil. If it feels moist, wait. If it feels dry, water thoroughly until it drains from the bottom. Empty the saucer after 30 minutes to prevent root rot. Most indoor plants want water once a week in summer, once every 10–14 days in winter. Always use room-temperature water — cold water shocks tropical roots.',

                heading: 'Soil, Pot & Drainage',
                body: 'Never use garden soil for pots — it compacts, reducing oxygen to roots. Use a quality potting mix appropriate for your plant type. Always ensure your pot has drainage holes. Terracotta pots are breathable and ideal for succulents; ceramic pots retain moisture and suit tropical plants. When repotting, go up only one pot size at a time — too-large pots hold excess moisture and invite root rot.',

Week 3: Wipe down leaves with a damp cloth to remove dust. Week 4: Check for any signs of pests (tiny dots, sticky residue). And most importantly — enjoy the process! Plants are patient teachers.',

        content: [
            { heading: '1. Morning Check-Ins', body: 'Spend 5 minutes each morning observing your plants. Look for drooping leaves (thirst or overwatering), yellowing (nutrient issues or overwatering), or pests hiding beneath leaves. Early detection prevents 90% of plant problems.' },
            { heading: '2. Seasonal Adjustments', body: 'Plants respond to seasons even indoors. Move plants closer to windows in winter when light is weaker. Increase watering frequency in summer. Reduce fertilizing in winter when plants enter a slow-growth period.' },
            { heading: '3. The Finger Test', body: 'Never water by schedule alone. Always push your finger 2cm into the soil. Water only when the top layer is dry. This simple habit prevents root rot — the #1 killer of houseplants.' },
            { heading: '4. Rotating for Even Growth', body: 'Plants grow toward light (phototropism). Rotate your pots 90 degrees every 2 weeks to encourage even, upright growth and prevent your plant from leaning.' },
            { heading: '5. Using Rainwater or Filtered Water', body: 'Tap water often contains chlorine and fluoride, which accumulate in soil and damage sensitive roots. Let tap water sit in an open container overnight, or use rainwater or filtered water for the healthiest results.' },
            { heading: '6. Feeding During Growth Season', body: 'Fertilize every 2–4 weeks from March to September with a balanced liquid fertilizer. Skip fertilizing entirely from October to February when most plants rest.' },
            { heading: '7. Pruning Dead Growth', body: 'Remove dead, yellow, or brown leaves with clean scissors immediately. This directs the plant\'s energy to healthy new growth rather than trying to revive damaged tissue.' },
            { heading: '8. Humidity Awareness', body: 'Most tropical houseplants prefer 40–60% humidity. In dry climates or during winter, mist your plants lightly, place a water tray with pebbles beneath the pot, or run a small humidifier nearby.' },
            { heading: '9. Pest Prevention', body: 'Inspect new plants thoroughly before bringing them home. Quarantine new arrivals for 1–2 weeks. Use neem oil spray once a month as a preventive treatment across your entire collection.' },
            { heading: '10. Learning to Read Your Plant', body: 'Every plant communicates. Drooping but moist soil = overwatering. Crispy brown tips = low humidity or underwatering. Pale, washed-out leaves = too much direct sun. Dark green but no growth = too little light. Trust your observations.' },

            { heading: '🌸 Spring (March–May) — The Growth Season', body: 'Spring is the most important season for plant care. Begin fertilizing again after the winter pause. Repot root-bound plants into slightly larger containers. Increase watering frequency as temperatures rise. Begin pest inspection routines with the warming weather. This is also the best time to propagate — take stem cuttings from healthy growth for new plants.' },
            { heading: '☀️ Summer (June–August) — Heat Management', body: 'Water more frequently — soil dries faster in warm weather. Watch for sunburn on leaves near south-facing windows — use sheer curtains to diffuse harsh midday light. Many plants will need watering twice a week or even more in peak heat. Increase humidity by misting or grouping plants together. Continue fertilizing through summer.' },
            { heading: '🍂 Autumn (September–November) — Transition', body: 'Gradually reduce watering as growth slows. Move plants away from cold windows and drafts. Stop fertilizing by end of October. Check for and treat any pest infestations before winter when plants are most vulnerable. Clean leaves to maximise light absorption in the shorter days ahead.' },
            { heading: '❄️ Winter (December–February) — Dormancy Care', body: 'Reduce watering significantly — most plants need 50% less water in winter. Do not fertilize. Keep plants away from cold drafts, heater vents, and radiators. Use grow lights if natural light is insufficient. Be extra vigilant against root rot — cold + wet soil is lethal. Dust leaves to maximise the reduced sunlight your plants receive.' },
